		 Have a clear outline and goal as to what your game will acheive. Being well organized with your plan will make it easier when developing the rest of the game.

	<h3  id = "Part2">Step 2</h3>

		 One of the most important aspects of an RPG is the world that you create for the player. Have a well thought out story that allows the player to get immersed in the world. A game like Elder Scrolls has a well thought out world with an immense amount of lore.

	<h3 id = "Part3">Step 3</h3>
	<div class ="container">

		 You must be able to develop a combat system that is enjoyable and balanced. Combat is an aspect of the game that the player will constantly be using which make sit one of the most vital parts of your game. Dark Souls is a great example of a game whose combat system alone is very engaging and may keep a player interested throughout the story.

	<h3 id = "Part4">Step 4</h3>
	<div class ="container">

		 Lastly you must decide what the players goal is within the world, and also decide what they will ultimately be doing throughout your game. This often involves quests, a storyline with missions, crafting, determining the scope of the players freedom, and how exactly they will interact with the world.
