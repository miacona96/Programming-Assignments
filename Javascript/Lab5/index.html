            <h2> Biography </h2>
            <p> 
                My name is Michael Iacona and I am a junior at Steven's majoring in computer science.  I spend most of my time either working out, reading, gaming, or hanging out with my girlfriend. I also spend a lot of time training or playing with my new Boston Terrier puppy who is now 9 months old and extremely hyper. I recently began learning how to cook and would like to pick up guitar again after stopping many years ago. My biggest aspiration is to become a good programmer and to find a job after school because debt is scary.
