        <p>
            I wanna be the very best, Like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test; to train them is my cause. I will travel across the land, searching far and wide. Each Pokemon to understand, the power that's inside Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) its you and me. I know its my destiny. Pokemon are my best friends. In a world we must defend. Pokemon, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true. Our courage will pull us through. You teach me and I'll teach you (Po-ke-mon) I gotta catch 'em all. Every challenge along the way, with courage I will face it. I will battle every day to claim my rightful place Come with me, the time is right. There's no better team. Arm in arm we'll win the fight, it's always been our dream. Pokemon! (Gotta catch 'em all). It's you and me. I know it's my destiny.
